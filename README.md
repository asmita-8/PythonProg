##Deep learning codes are as follows:
1. dl1.py: implementation of different functions and their derivatives.Then plotting them.
2. dl2.py: FNN-->calculation of the final activation function(XOR FUNCTION)for a neural network having 1 hidden layer(2 nodes)and 1 output layer(1 node) for which weights and biases are given.
